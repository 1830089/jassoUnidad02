						CAC speaking events and gallery exhibits take place inside Hotel Contempo, at 309 1st Avenue, in Downtown Seattle. Just a walk to the Space Needle, and a sampling of restaurants and shopping makes the venue a much sought-after location for conferences, year after year.
						Hotel Contempo is the perfect spot for a gathering of modern artists. Not only are the conference rooms and halls decked with breathtaking contemporary art and sculptures, but the individual rooms are as unique as the renowned artists who were commissioned to decorate them.
